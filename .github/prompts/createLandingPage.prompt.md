Create a professional, high-converting landing page using Next.js and the specified CSS framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind). The landing page should include:

## Required Sections
1. **Hero Section** - Impactful headline with video background or compelling visual, clear value proposition, and prominent CTA buttons
2. **Statistics Section** - Display key business metrics (companies served, customer satisfaction, success rates, revenue/savings impact)
3. **Social Proof** - Logos or names of trusted companies/clients
4. **Features Section** - Highlight 3-6 main product/service benefits with icons, descriptions, and bullet points
5. **Testimonials Section** - Real or realistic customer reviews with ratings, names, titles, and photos/avatars
6. **CTA Section** - Strong call-to-action with lead capture form, benefit reinforcement, and urgency elements
7. **Footer** - Complete footer with links (Product, Company, Support, Legal), social media, contact info, and copyright

## Copywriting Techniques
- Use persuasive hooks and emotional triggers in headlines
- Apply scarcity and urgency principles
- Include clear benefit-oriented messaging
- Add trust signals (guarantees, no credit card required, cancellation policy)
- Write action-oriented CTAs with specific outcomes

## Technical Requirements
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes (mobile-first approach)
- Add smooth scroll animations and hover effects
- Use semantic HTML and proper meta tags for SEO
- Include Open Graph metadata for social sharing
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios)
- Optimize for performance (lazy loading, preconnect to external resources)

## Styling Guidelines
- Maintain consistent color scheme with CSS variables
- Create reusable component classes
- Add microinteractions and transition effects
- Ensure visual hierarchy with typography scale
- Use gradients and shadows for depth

## File Structure
- Create/update `page.tsx` with all sections
- Configure `globals.css` with custom styles and animations
- Update `layout.tsx` with proper metadata and SEO configuration
- Add necessary TypeScript declarations for CSS modules if needed

Apply the business metrics and features provided by the user, adapting the content to match their specific industry and value proposition.
